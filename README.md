# Dashboard Development for APOL1 Patients in UK

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the geographical distribution and healthcare infrastructure for potential APOL1-positive patients across the United Kingdom. The analysis focuses on demographic patterns, healthcare accessibility, and community support systems.

## Key Features
- Geographic distribution analysis of at-risk populations
- Healthcare coverage and accessibility assessment
- Immigration pattern analysis
- Community support infrastructure mapping
- Age demographic analysis

## Data Sources
- Regional healthcare facility data
- Immigration statistics (1951-2021)
- Ethnic population distribution
- Community center and support facility mapping
- Healthcare coverage metrics

## Analysis Components
1. Population Distribution
   - Regional concentration of at-risk populations
   - Urban vs. rural distribution patterns
   - Immigration timeline analysis

2. Healthcare Infrastructure
   - Coverage analysis by region
   - Testing facility distribution
   - Healthcare accessibility scores

3. Community Support
   - Community centers distribution
   - Cultural associations mapping
   - Religious institutions analysis

## Key Findings
- Greater London shows highest concentration (868,161 potential patients)
- Significant healthcare coverage gaps (ranging 45-75%)
- Strong correlation between urban centers and APOL1 risk factors
- Multi-generational risk patterns identified through immigration analysis
