### Project Outline: APOL1 Heat Map Development

#### **Project Title:** 
Data Collection for Identifying Geographic Regions with APOL1-Positive Patients in the UK

#### **Objective:**
To gather, organize, and validate data sources to identify regions with the highest number of APOL1-positive patients, forming the foundation for a geographic heat map.

---

### **Phase I: Data Gathering**

#### **1. Primary Hypothesis:**
Regions with higher populations of individuals of African descent in the UK are more likely to have a higher prevalence of APOL1-positive patients.

#### **2. Data Source Identification:**
- **Public Healthcare Databases:**
  - NHS resources
  - UK Biobank
  - Genomics England
- **Forums and Patient Advocacy Groups:**
  - Online communities and social media platforms
  - Patient support groups for kidney diseases
- **Academic Publications and Clinical Trials:**
  - PubMed
  - ClinicalTrials.gov
- **Public Health Datasets:**
  - Office for National Statistics (ONS)
  - Public Health England (PHE)

#### **3. Raw Data Collection:**
- Compile a comprehensive list of data sources.
- Document access links, permissions, and relevance.
- Extract raw data from identified sources.

---

### **Phase II: Data Consolidation and Preprocessing**

#### **1. Data Structuring:**
- Organize data into structured formats suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- Annotate data with metadata (source, relevance, date).

#### **2. Data Quality Assessment:**
- Verify data consistency and reliability.
- Assess the relevance and quality of data collected.
- Document any restrictions or limitations on usage.

#### **3. Preliminary Insights:**
- Highlight regions or trends observed during the collection process.
- Initial observations on potential high-priority regions based on data trends.

---

### **Phase III: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### **1. Data Exploration:**
- Conduct descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
- Identify patterns and correlations related to APOL1 prevalence.

#### **2. Visualization:**
- Create initial visualizations to explore geographic distribution.
- Use charts and graphs to identify potential hotspots.

---

### **Phase IV: Heat Map Development**

#### **1. Data Preparation for Heat Map:**
- Clean and preprocess data for geographic analysis.
- Ensure data is geocoded for mapping purposes.

#### **2. Dashboard Creation:**
- Develop a dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- Integrate a heat map to visualize geographic regions with APOL1-positive patients.

#### **3. Final Analysis and Reporting:**
- Provide a comprehensive report with findings and insights.
- Highlight key regions for further investigation or intervention.
